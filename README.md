# Time Series Project


The project was completed as the end of semester project for my time series class. The dataset comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume. The project modelled traffic volume using seasonal ARIMA model and looked at potential weather factors associating with the traffic volume. The resulting paper and code for paper are shown here. The presentation is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWObCJ8uKqMyP5UL-KnX3pqaCW3RwpI-LoJNN9spDpM.
