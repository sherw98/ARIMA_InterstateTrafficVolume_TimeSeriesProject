# Time Series Project


The project was completed as the end of semester project for my time series class. The dataset comes from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume. The project modeled traffic volume using a seasonal ARIMA model and looked at potential weather factors associating with the traffic volume. The resulting paper and code for paper are shown here. The presentation is here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IWObCJ8uKqMyP5UL-KnX3pqaCW3RwpI-LoJNN9spDpM.
